### first question - python
If you need to use library you can use "import" at beginning of code
example:
import random

### second question - python
The type we recived from users is always "string".
"input" function will always recived string type.

### third question - Git
In git we can use "branches" that other team mates can work on the same file in different departments (like dev, prod, test etc...).
In Branch we can work without harm the master file.

### fourth question - SQL
I would use 2 tables name "department" and "Student".
from both of tables we can use PK(Primary Key) that will be used for
join table without need to change anything if we will create ONLY one table.
